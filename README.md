# AKA Energy Systems â€“ Landing Pages Portfolio

## Overview

As a freelance front-end developer, I partnered with AKA Energy Systems to deliver two high-impact landing pages under a tight deadline for an upcoming conference. My responsibilities included meeting with the team to gather requirements, designing and developing the pages, creating custom icons, and iterating on the design through feedback rounds to ensure the final product met their needs.
